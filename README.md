# Introduction

Welcome to the 'Cyberattacks Detection Project' This repository contains the resources and tools necessary for detecting and analyzing cyberattacks using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The project is designed to provide insights into cybersecurity threats by leveraging a dataset of network activity.

# Project Overview

This project involves:
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring and preprocessing the cyberattacks dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating machine learning models to detect potential cyber threats.
- **Visualization**: Using various visualization techniques to understand the data and the results.

The primary focus of this project is to develop a robust system that can help identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats in real-time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Steps
